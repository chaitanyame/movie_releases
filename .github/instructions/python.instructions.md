# Python Instructions

When working with Python files in this project:

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting
- Use context managers (with statements) for resources
- Include docstrings for modules, classes, and functions

## File Organization

- Organize imports: stdlib, third-party, local
- Use `__all__` to define public API
- Keep functions focused and small

## Testing

- Write pytest tests for new functionality
- Use fixtures for test setup
- Include both positive and negative test cases
