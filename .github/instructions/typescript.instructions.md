# TypeScript/JavaScript Instructions

When working with TypeScript or JavaScript files in this project:

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for new files when possible
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use async/await over raw promises
- Include proper error handling with try/catch
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions

## File Organization

- One component/class per file
- Group imports: external, then internal
- Export from index files for clean imports

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions
