## Next Session: Start Here

### Immediate Next Steps

**Continue Foundational Phase**: Features 11-13 (3 remaining)

1. **Setup Phase (Features 1-5)** - ~1 hour
   - Validate environment (Node 18+, Playwright)
   - Create placeholder JSON files
   - Set up .env with API key
   - Verify test infrastructure

2. **Foundational Phase (Features 6-13)** - ~2 hours
   - Update date-utils.js with three-week functions
   - Create JSON schemas for validation
   - Update week-transition.js logic
   - Create base HTML and CSS structure

3. **User Story 1 Implementation (Features 14-25)** - ~3 hours
   - **TDD GATE 1**: Create failing tests (Features 14-16)
   - Implement current week view (Features 17-24)
   - **TDD GATE 2**: Verify tests pass (Feature 25)

**Estimated Time to MVP**: 6-8 hours (2-3 sessions)

### Environment Setup Required

Before starting Feature 1, ensure:

```bash
# Verify Node version
node --version  # Should be >= 18

# Verify Playwright
npx playwright --version  # Should be >= 1.48

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### TDD Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every feature implementation MUST follow:

**GATE 1 (Pre-Implementation)**:
- Feature has `test_file` field → Create test first
- Run test → MUST FAIL
- Update `feature_list.json`: `test_fails_before: true`
- Cannot proceed to implementation until gate passes

**GATE 2 (Post-Implementation)**:
- Run test → MUST PASS
- Update `feature_list.json`: `test_passes_after: true`, `passes: true`
- Cannot mark feature complete without passing test

**GATE 3 (Verification)**:
- Features 25, 36, 47, 57, 67 are verification gates
- Run full test suite for user story
- All tests must pass before moving to next user story

### File Modification Strategy

**High Priority Files** (MVP - Features 1-25):
- `scripts/utils/date-utils.js` - Three-week functions (Feature 6)
- `scripts/utils/week-transition.js` - Sliding window logic (Feature 9)
- `scripts/fetch-releases.js` - API prompts & data fetching (Features 10, 17, 18)
- `assets/js/app.js` - Frontend logic (Features 19-23)
- `index.html` - Navigation structure (Features 12, 24)
- `assets/css/main.css` - Styling (Feature 13)

**Medium Priority Files** (Post-MVP):
- Week navigation handlers (Features 26-47)
- URL routing (Features 58-67)
- Category configuration (Features 48-57)

**Low Priority Files** (Polish):
- GitHub Actions workflow (Feature 68)
- Integration tests (Feature 69)
- Performance/accessibility audits (Features 70-72)

### Independent User Stories

After MVP (Features 1-25) complete, these can be implemented in any order:
- **User Story 2** (Features 26-36): Last week navigation
- **User Story 3** (Features 37-47): Next week preview
- **User Story 5** (Features 58-67): Shareable URLs

**User Story 4** (Features 48-57) enhances all user stories - recommend implementing after US1 works.

## Known Issues

*None yet - feature implementation not started*

## Decisions Made

1. **Three-week model**: Concurrent files (last/current/next) vs archive model
2. **Country-specific categories**: US (distribution) vs India (language/industry)
3. **TDD mandatory**: Every feature has pre-implementation test requirement
4. **MVP scope**: User Story 1 only - can deploy after Feature 25
5. **Zero dependencies**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS maintained throughout

## For Next Agent

### If Starting Fresh

1. Read this file for context
2. Start with Feature 1 (Setup phase)
3. Follow TDD gates strictly (failing test → implement → passing test)
4. Update `feature_list.json` as you complete features
5. Commit after each feature or logical group

### If Resuming Work

1. Check feature_list.json for last completed feature (where `passes: true`)
2. Find first feature with `passes: false`
3. If feature has `test_file`: Verify test exists, run it (should fail for GATE 1)
4. Implement feature
5. Run test again (should pass for GATE 2)
6. Update feature_list.json and commit

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific feature tests
npm test tests/features/*current-week*
npm test tests/features/*last-week*
npm test tests/features/*next-week*

# Run with UI (helpful for debugging)
npm run test:ui

# Run performance audit
npm run test:performance
```

### Committing Work

- Commit after each feature: `git commit -m "feat: complete feature #{id} - {name}"`
- Update this file before ending session
- Push to remote: `git push origin 001-movie-releases`

## Constitution Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Zero runtime dependencies maintained (no npm packages in production)
- [ ] Temporal data integrity preserved (ISO week boundaries)
- [ ] TDD gates enforced (failing test → implement → passing test)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (features, build, integration, performance)
- [ ] Progressive enhancement working (core content without JS)
